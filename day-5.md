## Thunder Client in VSCode

## The Light Bulb Moment
This exercise was an eye opener for me. So much easier than using postman to review JSON files. You only have to click to open the file in editor from the drop down at the top right of the response window. You can chose wether or not to save the files to your repository in vscode.

I have created the file list as day5... in this project to showcase the similarities between the files coming from Postman vs Thunder Client. Honestly, they are the same. Same in how you request the data and consume it via the response. The only difference is how you can view the entire file in a JSON file right there in vscode and also save it. No more having to copy the code from Postman then create the JSON file in VSCode to store it. 

The one flaw that I have not been able to do was delete the created repository after creating it using thunder client; which again, works exactly like Postman does. This is a bummer as you would have to access the GitHub website to remove the repository or I just have not found the correct answer on how to do that. 

## The Bane of My Life
I see an issue when it comes to repetitive data parameters such as links, users, tokens, and etc. There is not clear cut way on where or how to write said variables like there are in postman. Nor how to call said variables from the environment or saved collection into a new request.
