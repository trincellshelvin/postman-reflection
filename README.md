# postman-reflection
In using the postman website, I learned several things.
- How to setup the collections folder so that I am able to easily find grouped requests. 
- How to get the request and watch the exact link that I am using to avoid the error 404 when requesting items.
- How to share the request as a link in this readme (below).
- How to copy the codes into a .json file to make it much easier to read. 
- That your connection speed and throttle issues plays a huge role in how fast the request is received back to your workspace. 

## pikachu
To retrieve Pikachu, it took 414ms with a status 200 ok with a file size of 7.82kb. Not too eventful, but a learning experience with my first one.

## butterfree
Retrieving ButterFree, same because I had the incorrect link so the error 404 kept coming up. Getting the request(once the link was corrected) took a speed of 286ms with a file size of 7.44kb receiving a 200ok message as well.
